    <h1>Pandas Learning from Kaggle</h1>
    <p>This repository contains my notes, examples, and exercises on:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Creating, Reading and Writing</li>
      <li>Indexing, Selecting & Assigning</li>
      <li>Summary Functions and Maps</li>
      <li>Grouping and Sorting</li>
      <li>Data Types and Missing Values</li>
